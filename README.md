# Hailie-Santiago-Final-Project
For my final project I wanted to study the impact of listners after listening to the different albums that Kendrick Lamar has produced over the years. This study will help me see what listenrs took from the albums and overall there emotional state after listening. 

DATA
The data used for analyses was gathering some of Kendrick Lamar's music. The question I wanted to figure out how much of an impact does Kendrick Lamar music has on his audience. Each unit of anaylsis was one song and 34 observations were collected in total for this experiment. The type of sampling strategy that was used was convenience sampling. 

I gathered the data by starting at one of the album and analyzing its lyric and intended meaning. Then I studied how listners not only reacted but asked for them to give a reflection of the album they listned to. 

OPERATIONALIZATION
This operationalizes the concept of emotional impact because I feel like this way of measuring the sense of emotion listeners feel are hearing the songs can give us a brief understanding of what these listeners experienced when listening to the album. I also feel like it is an okay way to measure the sense of emotion I also had the idea of possibly answering a series of questions from 1-10 rating how strongly they felt towards the song and then possibly trying to explain said emotion. 

The variable, lyric sentiment would be able to paint a clear sense of how the listeners feel about the album overall and help us determine which songs stood out most to some. 

 This variable, song duration operationalizes the concept because it would allow me to explain how the attention span of listeners can correlate with the success to certain songs and whether many even liked them or not. 

 
This variable, lyric complexity would allow me to determine how listeners felt about the lyrics of each song but overall, how they felt about the album as a whole.
